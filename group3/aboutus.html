					             seacoast - our prestigious heritage shapes our bright future<br><br><br>

                                 The seacoast name is proudly borne by a growing collection of distinguished properties around the world. As sri lanka’s oldest luxury hotel group, we are committed to providing our guests with memorable journeys inspired by exquisite sri lankan flair. We believe life should be lived with style.<br><br>

                                 Each year, an increasing number of guests come to appreciate these qualities, as seacoast adds new, exciting destinations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and The Americas. While this growth reflects the strength and success of the seacoast brand, the collection will remain a limited one, where exclusivity can be nurtured and individuality can flourish.<br><br>

                                 We believe that our prestigious sri lankan heritage puts seacoast in a unique position to satisfy the expectations of the stylish and discerning traveller. It’s not just to simply provide a hotel bed and a meal, at seacoast it’s all about bringing a story to life.<br><br><img src="images/6.png" alt="" width="150"  height="150">

                                 Since 1897, our employees have been a part of creating history around the world. From historic buildings to the most avant-garde of modern architecture, our properties are the setting for some of life’s greatest moments. We’ve witnessed historic meetings between world leaders, celebrities taking sanctuary in the world of privacy we create for them, and created incredible memories for guests on a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ journey.<br><br>

                                 We are wholeheartedly committed to providing perfection for our guests at every moment and in every way. Perhaps it’s something as life-changing as a wedding celebration, where our attention to detail and perfect service mean that your special day goes without a hitch. Or perhaps it’s as simple as the note left on your pillow at night, which thoughtfully lets you know the weather tomorrow so you know how to dress in the morning. At seacoast, we are each personally responsible for creating rich and meaningful experiences for our guests.<br><br>
